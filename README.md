# PlayBrain
[this is not created, this is a WIP]
*The Netplay mod for Wii.*

## What this is
This is a continuation of MrBean35000vr's work, NetSlug, which allowed two players, one as host and one as guest, to connect and play together.

This was built off of the Wii patching engine BrainSlug, by Bean's brother, Chadderz (known on GitHub as Chadderz121). It patches the disc directly using C, using "modules" to make changes as needed.

We aim to continue where MrBean and Chadderz left their projects off at.

*If you're interested in NetSlug and BrainSlug, you can find downloads [here](https://github.com/jbmagination/PlayBrain/releases/tag/slug).*
## Goals
- [ ] 3-8 player support
- [ ] An actual GUI interface
- [ ] Traversal server alongside direct connections
- [ ] Remove need for config.ini for connections
