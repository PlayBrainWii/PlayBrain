# PlayBrain
[this is not created, this is a WIP]

The Netplay mod for Wii.

This is based off of MrBean35000vr's NetSlug, which is based off of Chadderz's BrainSlug. You can find a direct link to BrainSlug [here](), but there is no compiled NetSlug download on GitHub, so you can find that [here]().
