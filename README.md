# PlayBrain
[this is not created, this is a WIP]

The Netplay mod for Wii.

This is based off of MrBean35000vr's NetSlug, which is based off of Chadderz's BrainSlug (README for NetSlug, which contains BrainSlug's README, can be found [here](https://github.com/jbmagination/playbrain/blob/master/netslug-README)). You can find a direct link to BrainSlug [here](), but there is no compiled NetSlug download on GitHub, so you can find that [here]().
